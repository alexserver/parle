# Authentication Testing Checklist

## Phase 6: Testing & Security Validation

### üîê Authentication Flow Testing

#### Sign-Up Flow
- [ ] **New User Registration**
  - [ ] Visit landing page at `/`
  - [ ] Click "Get Started" button
  - [ ] Complete sign-up flow
  - [ ] Verify redirect to `/dashboard` after successful registration
  - [ ] Confirm welcome message displays user's name
  - [ ] Check that user stats show 0 transcripts initially

#### Sign-In Flow  
- [ ] **Existing User Login**
  - [ ] Visit landing page at `/`
  - [ ] Click "Sign In" button
  - [ ] Complete sign-in flow
  - [ ] Verify redirect to `/dashboard` after successful login
  - [ ] Confirm user's existing transcripts are displayed
  - [ ] Check user stats reflect actual transcript counts

#### Sign-Out Flow
- [ ] **Session Termination**
  - [ ] Click UserButton in header
  - [ ] Select "Sign Out" option
  - [ ] Verify redirect to landing page `/`
  - [ ] Confirm user is logged out (no protected content visible)
  - [ ] Test that accessing protected routes redirects to landing page

### üõ°Ô∏è Route Protection Testing

#### Protected Route Access
- [ ] **Unauthenticated Access**
  - [ ] Try accessing `/dashboard` without authentication ‚Üí Should redirect to `/?sign-in=true`
  - [ ] Try accessing `/upload` without authentication ‚Üí Should redirect with prompt
  - [ ] Try accessing `/transcripts` without authentication ‚Üí Should redirect with prompt
  - [ ] Try accessing `/transcripts/[id]` without authentication ‚Üí Should redirect with prompt

- [ ] **Authentication Redirect Flow**
  - [ ] Visit protected route while unauthenticated
  - [ ] Verify sign-in prompt banner appears on landing page
  - [ ] Complete authentication
  - [ ] Confirm redirect back to originally requested route

#### Public Route Access
- [ ] **Landing Page Accessibility**
  - [ ] Landing page loads without authentication
  - [ ] All public content visible (features, CTA buttons)
  - [ ] Sign-in/sign-up buttons work correctly

### üîí Data Isolation Testing

#### User Data Separation
- [ ] **Multi-User Testing**
  - [ ] Create/sign in as User A
  - [ ] Upload audio file and create transcript
  - [ ] Note transcript ID and verify it appears in User A's dashboard
  - [ ] Sign out and create/sign in as User B  
  - [ ] Verify User B cannot see User A's transcripts in dashboard
  - [ ] Verify User B cannot access User A's transcript by direct URL
  - [ ] Upload different audio file as User B
  - [ ] Confirm User B only sees their own transcript

#### API Data Isolation
- [ ] **Database Query Filtering**
  - [ ] Verify `/api/transcripts` only returns current user's data
  - [ ] Test `/api/transcripts/[id]` returns 404 for other users' transcripts
  - [ ] Confirm upload endpoint associates new transcripts with current user
  - [ ] Check database records have correct userId values

### üõ°Ô∏è API Security Testing

#### Authentication Requirements
- [ ] **API Endpoint Protection**
  - [ ] Test `/api/transcripts` without auth token ‚Üí Should return 401
  - [ ] Test `/api/transcripts/[id]` without auth token ‚Üí Should return 401
  - [ ] Test `/api/upload` without auth token ‚Üí Should return 401
  - [ ] Test `/api/health` (should work without auth)

#### Token Validation
- [ ] **JWT Token Security**
  - [ ] Test API calls with invalid/expired token ‚Üí Should return 401
  - [ ] Test API calls with malformed token ‚Üí Should return 401
  - [ ] Verify proper JWT signature validation
  - [ ] Test token refresh scenarios

#### Request Validation
- [ ] **Input Validation**
  - [ ] Test upload with invalid file types ‚Üí Should return 400
  - [ ] Test upload with oversized files (>25MB) ‚Üí Should return 400
  - [ ] Test malformed requests ‚Üí Should return appropriate errors
  - [ ] Verify SQL injection protection in transcript ID parameters

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling Testing

#### Authentication Errors
- [ ] **Auth Failure Scenarios**
  - [ ] Network errors during token fetch
  - [ ] Authentication service unavailable
  - [ ] Token refresh failures
  - [ ] Verify user-friendly error messages
  - [ ] Test error recovery flows

#### API Error Handling
- [ ] **Backend Error Responses**
  - [ ] Database connection failures
  - [ ] File system errors during upload
  - [ ] Transcription service errors
  - [ ] Verify proper error logging
  - [ ] Test error boundary functionality

#### Network Issues
- [ ] **Connectivity Problems**
  - [ ] Offline scenarios
  - [ ] Slow network conditions
  - [ ] Request timeouts
  - [ ] Verify graceful degradation

### üîÑ Session Management Testing

#### Session Persistence
- [ ] **Browser Session Handling**
  - [ ] Refresh page while authenticated ‚Üí Should stay logged in
  - [ ] Close and reopen browser ‚Üí Should maintain session
  - [ ] Multiple tabs ‚Üí Session should sync across tabs

#### Session Expiration
- [ ] **Token Lifecycle**
  - [ ] Test behavior when JWT expires
  - [ ] Verify automatic token refresh
  - [ ] Test logout after extended inactivity
  - [ ] Confirm redirect to sign-in when session expires

### üîç Security Best Practices Review

#### Authentication Security
- [ ] **Token Handling**
  - [ ] JWT tokens not exposed in client-side storage
  - [ ] Secure token transmission (HTTPS)
  - [ ] Proper token expiration times
  - [ ] No sensitive data in JWT claims

#### API Security
- [ ] **Backend Protection**
  - [ ] All sensitive endpoints require authentication
  - [ ] User input validation and sanitization
  - [ ] Proper error message disclosure (no internal info)
  - [ ] Rate limiting considerations
  - [ ] CORS configuration review

#### Data Protection
- [ ] **Privacy & Security**
  - [ ] User data properly isolated by userId
  - [ ] No cross-user data leakage
  - [ ] Uploaded files secured by user context
  - [ ] Proper logging without sensitive data exposure
